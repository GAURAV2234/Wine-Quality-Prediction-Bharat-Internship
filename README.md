This project revolves around utilizing diverse machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of red wine, utilizing Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset. Each wine in the dataset is assigned a quality score between 0 and 10, which has been converted into a binary output: wines are categorized as either “good quality” (scoring 7 or higher) or not (scoring below 7) based on eleven input variables:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol
The objectives of this project are:

Experimenting with various classification methods to determine the most accurate one.
Identifying the key features that strongly influence a wine’s quality.
The steps involved in this project include:

Importing libraries
Loading the dataset
Understanding the data
Managing missing values
Exploring and analyzing the variables
Selecting essential features
Analyzing the proportion of good versus bad wines
Preparing the data for modeling
Implementing different models
Selecting the most suitable model
Task completion with success!
